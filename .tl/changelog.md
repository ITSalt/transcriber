# Changelog — .tl/

## [2026-05-18] Post-intake cleanup — DELIVERED (Phase 6)
- **Final state:** all 30 plan tasks at terminal status. 28 `done`, 2 `verified-pending` (UC-200-BE / UC-300-BE — provider E2E gated on API keys).
- **Remote:** `git@github.com:ITSalt/transcriber.git`; default branch `main` at `5258a11`.
- **CI green:** [run 26045597888](https://github.com/ITSalt/transcriber/actions/runs/26045597888) — Lint + Typecheck + Test PASS (after 3 CI workflow fix iterations).
- **TECH-015:** `verified-pending` → `done`.
- **Phase 6 deliver:** no separate staging deployment for this MVP (single-VM per CLAUDE.md); push-to-main + CI-green is the delivery gate.

## [2026-05-18] Post-intake cleanup — Phase 4/5 outcomes
- **Phase 4 (TECH-015):** git remote `git@github.com:ITSalt/transcriber.git` added; 3 logical commits pushed (a11y+RQ-031, .tl state+UC-001 docs sync+retroactive artifacts, prior-session housekeeping). Default branch flipped to `main` and `feature/intake-2026-05-18` HEAD pushed to remote `main` to fire CI.
  - First CI run (26045113249) failed all 9 jobs at `setup-node cache: pnpm` step — `pnpm-lock.yaml` was gitignored. Fixed by removing the gitignore entry, committing the lockfile, and switching workflow to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Re-pushed (461dc2a).
- **Phase 5 (UC-200/UC-300 pipeline E2E):** SKIPPED by user direction. Worker code is reviewed + unit-tested; provider E2E (Deepgram, kie.ai) deferred until `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` / `KIE_API_KEY` are supplied. Graph state: UC-200-BE and UC-300-BE remain `verified-pending` with `phase_qa = skip`; new flags `phase_5_outcome=SKIP`, `phase_5_reason` set.

## [2026-05-18] DOCS-SYNC UC-001 (Phase 1.5)
- F3: result-fe.md MeetingCard.tsx → MeetingRow.tsx (path corrected to components/MeetingRow.tsx); narrative "cards" → "rows"
- M1: result-be.md sort field corrected createdAt → updatedAt to match RQ-001; Prisma schema createdAt/updatedAt field names already correct in task-be.md domain table (snake_case is domain attribute convention, not drift)
- M2: MeetingStatus enum aligned with shared/src/enums.ts in task-be.md and task-fe.md — added CREATED/UPLOADED, renamed TRANSCRIPT_READY→TRANSCRIBED, PROTOCOL_GENERATING→GENERATING_PROTOCOL, FAILED→ERROR
- M3: pruned 2 unused imports (JobStatus, VideoMimeType) from api-contract.md TypeScript snippet

## [2026-05-18] POST-INTAKE CLEANUP — Agent 1-A: shared/ IStorage TS4113 + Zod v3/v4 split

**Scope:** shared/ package only (Agent 1-A). No api/, worker/, or web/ files modified.

### Bug 1 — shared/IStorage TS4113 (L1, no code change needed)

**Level:** L1 — code-only fix; already resolved in a prior commit.

**Root cause:** `StorageError` declared `public override readonly cause: unknown`, which triggered TS4113 because `Error.cause` is not part of the lib target chain in web's tsconfig, so the override was incompatible with the base type in the web compiler context.

**Fix (already applied in commit 77f4c73):** Renamed the field to `storageCause` (dropping the `override` keyword) in `shared/src/storage/IStorage.ts`. All consumers (api/src/storage/s3-adapter.ts) already use `storageCause`.

**Verification:** `pnpm --filter @transcrib/shared typecheck` → 0 errors. `pnpm --filter @transcrib/api typecheck` → 0 errors. `pnpm --filter @transcrib/worker typecheck` → 0 errors.

**Files changed:** none (fix pre-applied); `shared/src/storage/IStorage.ts` (current state is correct).

---

### Bug 2 — Zod v3/v4 split (L1, no code change needed in shared/)

**Level:** L1 — dependency-pinning / structural type mitigation; shared/ is already correct.

**Root cause:** `web/package.json` declares `"zod": "^3.25.76"` (resolving to 3.25.76 in pnpm virtual store) while `shared/`, `api/`, and `worker/` all use `zod@^4.4.3`. Two separate zod instances exist in the monorepo. Nothing in `web/src/` imports from zod directly — zod v3 in web is unused.

**Mitigation already in place:** `web/src/lib/api.ts` uses a structural duck-type interface `ZodLike<T> { parse(data: unknown): T }` rather than importing from zod, preventing any instanceof or type-assignability failures at the TypeScript level. Shared's own node_modules resolves zod to v4.4.3 correctly.

**Action needed (blocked — owned by another agent):** Remove or update `"zod": "^3.25.76"` in `web/package.json` to `"zod": "^4.4.3"` and re-run `pnpm install`. This is owned by the web/ agent.

**Verification:** `pnpm --filter @transcrib/shared test` → 69 passed. `pnpm --filter @transcrib/shared typecheck` → 0 errors. `pnpm test` → 463 passed, 7 skipped.

---

### Final state

- shared/ typecheck: CLEAN (0 errors)
- api/ typecheck: CLEAN (0 errors)
- worker/ typecheck: CLEAN (0 errors)
- web/ typecheck: 4 pre-existing errors in `ProtocolEditor.tsx` (out of scope, owned by web agent)
- Tests: 463 passed / 7 skipped (470 total) — baseline exceeded (was 457 before Agent 1-B a11y additions)

## [2026-05-18] nacl-tl-reconcile: Neo4j graph synced to .tl/status.json
- **Scope:** SMALL (30 Task nodes, status + 6 phase_* properties)
- **Trigger:** Orchestrator Phase 0 — Neo4j had all 30 tasks at status=pending with null phases while .tl/status.json showed 24 approved + 7 qa_pass + 2 qa_skip
- **Result:**
  - 27 tasks → status=done (14 TECH + 13 UC BE/FE pairs)
  - 3 tasks → status=verified-pending (TECH-015 CI uncommitted, UC-200-BE/UC-300-BE qa=skip pending API keys)
  - phase_be/phase_fe/phase_sync/phase_review_be/phase_review_fe/phase_qa populated per role
- **UNVERIFIED upstream fixes documented (operator-acknowledged):** TECH-003, TECH-004, TECH-015, UC-200-BE, UC-201-BE/FE, UC-300-BE, UC-301-BE/FE, UC-302-BE — all carry 100% test author overlap header from conductor workflow; non-blocking
- **Did not modify code or docs** — Neo4j-only sync; doc reconcile (UC-001 MeetingRow rename etc.) handled in Phase 1.5

## [2026-05-18] POST-INTAKE CLEANUP — Agent 1-B: UC-001 catalog a11y fixes

**Scope:** web/src/routes/catalog/* only (Agent 1-B)

### Issue 1 — Catalog SSE /api/meetings/events 404 (L1, no code change)
- Decision: REMOVE — UC-001 spec (task-fe.md, api-contract.md) mandates no catalog-wide SSE endpoint; ADR-010 specifies per-meeting SSE only. Polling via `refetchInterval` already satisfies RQ-002.
- Finding: The catalog `index.tsx` already had NO EventSource call — the speculative SSE scaffolding was never written (or was cleaned up prior). No code change required.

### Issue 2 — a11y aria-label on table, aria-live on badges (L1)
- Added `aria-label={t("catalog.tableLabel")}` to `<Table>` in `web/src/routes/catalog/index.tsx`.
- Wrapped `<Badge>` in `<span aria-live="polite">` in `web/src/routes/catalog/components/StatusBadge.tsx`.
- Added i18n keys `catalog.tableLabel`: "Meeting catalog" (EN) / "Каталог встреч" (RU) to both locale files.
- Added 2 a11y test cases to `web/src/routes/catalog/index.test.tsx`: table role by name and aria-live assertion.
- Tests: 18/18 passed (catalog); 126/126 passed (full web suite); typecheck clean.

## [2026-05-18] REVIEW-BE UC-001: View meeting catalog — APPROVED (commit e4d6bf2)
- Stub Gate: PASSED
- Result: approved
- Issues: 0 blocker, 0 critical, 0 major, 4 minor (doc drift M1-M4)
- Tests: 10/10 passed

- Tests: 441 passed, 7 skipped (Prisma smoke, needs DB)
- Typecheck: clean
- Lint: 0 errors, 114 warnings (no-explicit-any in test mocks — acceptable)
- TECH-015: verified-pending (actionlint unavailable, .github/workflows/ci.yml untracked)
- Follow-up commits incorporated: 8e92405 (UC-200/UC-300 worker), 77f4c73 (UC-301-FE shared tsconfig)
- Lint fixes applied: 12 errors resolved (unused vars, consistent-type-imports, no-empty-object-type)

## [PLAN] 2026-05-18

- Created development plan from the Neo4j graph (`/nacl-tl-plan`, scope=full).
- Generated 9 UC tasks (BE+FE per UC; SYSTEM-actor UC-200/UC-300 are BE-only worker tasks; UC-302 is BE-only with UI hooks in UC-002/UC-301 FE).
- Generated 15 TECH tasks covering full-stack infrastructure (monorepo, Docker stack, Prisma, shared Zod, Fastify, BullMQ, S3/MinIO, TUS, ffmpeg, Deepgram ASR, kie.ai LLM, SSE, web scaffold, Puppeteer PDF, CI).
- Defined 6 execution waves with dependency-honoring topological ordering.
- API contracts authored for all 9 UCs with Zod schemas, error tables, and authentication notes (NFR-007 no-auth at MVP).
- Source: Neo4j SA layer — 4 modules, 9 UCs, 6 domain entities, 53 requirements, 2 system roles, 4 enums.
- Neo4j TL layer populated: 6 Wave nodes, 30 Task nodes, IN_WAVE/DEPENDS_ON/GENERATES edges.
- 117 task files written under `.tl/tasks/`.

## [2026-05-18] FIX UC-301 RQ-031: Unsaved-changes guard — L1 (Agent 1-C)

**Scope:** web/src/routes/protocol/* only.

**Level:** L1 — code-only fix. `unsavedChangesWarning` i18n key already existed; RQ-031 behavior was specified. The `isDirty` flag existed but Milkdown `onChange` was never wired, so `isDirty` never became `true`. No navigation blocker was registered.

**Root cause:** `isDirty` was never set to `true` because `ProtocolEditor` had no `onChange` prop and the Milkdown listener plugin was not integrated; consequently `useBlocker` was absent and the Dialog guard was never rendered.

**Changes:**
- `web/src/routes/protocol/components/ProtocolEditor.tsx` — added `onChange?: () => void` prop; integrated `@milkdown/plugin-listener` (`listenerCtx.markdownUpdated`) to fire `onChange` on each Milkdown doc change.
- `web/src/routes/protocol/index.tsx` — wired `onChange={() => setIsDirty(true)}` to `ProtocolEditor`; replaced `handleBack` direct-navigate with `useBlocker(isDirty)` from react-router; replaced `window.confirm` calls with a shadcn `Dialog` component (`data-testid="unsaved-changes-dialog"`) with Confirm (`blocker.proceed`) and Cancel (`blocker.reset`) buttons.
- `web/src/i18n/en.json` / `ru.json` — added `protocol.unsavedChanges.{title,body,confirm,cancel}` keys in EN and RU.
- `web/package.json` — added `@milkdown/plugin-listener@^7.21.1` dependency.

**New tests (6):** Added `describe("RQ-031: unsaved-changes guard")` to `web/src/routes/protocol/index.test.tsx`:
1. isDirty=false on render, no dialog shown
2. onChange fired → isDirty becomes true (editor remains visible)
3. Navigation while dirty → confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirm click → `blocker.proceed` → navigation completes
5. Cancel click → `blocker.reset` → user stays on protocol page

## [2026-05-18 23:45] REVIEW-BE UC-300: Protocol generation (worker) - APPROVED (commit 0c11bf3 + 8e92405)
- Stub Gate: PASSED
- Result: approved
- Issues: 0 blocker, 0 critical, 0 major, 5 minor (doc drift M1-M5: spec uses pre-rename JobStatus/MeetingStatus values; impl-brief filenames stale; prompt_template_version not persisted - schema lacks column)
- Tests: 457/464 passed at monorepo level (7 skipped: prisma smoke; expected baseline); UC-300 contributes 29 passing
- Test author independence: MAJOR (100% overlap - conductor workflow override applied)
- Checklist: all 8 categories PASS
- Code anchors: worker/src/jobs/protocol-generation.ts, worker/src/jobs/protocol-generation.test.ts, shared/src/llm/ILlmProvider.ts, worker/src/llm/kieai.ts
- ADR-007 honored: ILlmProvider abstraction in place, no direct kie.ai SDK in handler
- BRQ-008 honored: Meeting.status mirror in single $transaction
- BRQ-009 honored: terminal-state guards via WHERE status PENDING/PROCESSING in updateMany
- Follow-up: route M1-M5 doc drift through /nacl-tl-reconcile before UC-300 final sign-off
